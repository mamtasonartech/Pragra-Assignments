#Working With Basic Operations

# 6.	Create two integer variables and print their multiplication.
num1 = 10
num2 = 2
mul = num1 * num2
print(mul)

# 7.	Create a float variable and add 10 to it. Print the result.
fnum1 = 5.25
print(fnum1 + 10)

# 8.	Create two variables containing numbers. Print which one is greater.
number3 = 10
number4 = 20
if number3 > number4:
        print("Number 3 is greater than Number 4")
else:
        print("Number 4 is greater than Number 3")

# 9.	Create a variable that stores a number. Print the number plus 5.
number5 = 20
print(number5 + 5)

# 10.	Create two variables with numbers and print their difference.
number6 = 25
number7 = 20
diff = number6 - number7
print(diff)
